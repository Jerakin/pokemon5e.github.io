# *The Wonderful World of Pokémon*

# *- in Dungeons & Dragons 5E*

![icon](img/splash.png)


Pokémon5E is a homebrew system to D&D that layers the world of Pokémon on top of the core rules of D&D. If you have never played Dungeons & Dragons before, do not worry as the 5th edition is easy to get into! You do not need a lot to start playing: a few friends, the [D&D Basic Rules](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules), a couple of dice (or a dice app!) and of course the Pokémon5E supplement!

The supplement is created by [@JOEtheDM](https://twitter.com/joethedm), whom can also be seen as the host of [@You Meet in a Tavern](https://twitter.com/ymiatavern).
